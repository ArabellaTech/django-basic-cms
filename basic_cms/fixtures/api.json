Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not defined herein shall have the definitions provided in our Terms of Use. This Policy describes the ways we or our vendors collect, protect, use and store your personal information. You accept this Privacy Policy when you use our products and services on our website on a mobile device or through any other means (Collectively the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, do not use the Nutricia App or any of the Services.</p>\r\n<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>\r\n<p>Information You Give Us. Nutricia collects information and gives you a number of options regarding information you will give us at the following points:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When you register to create an account with Nutricia (whether through one of the Nutricia Apps or on the Internet);</li>\r\n<li>When you participate on a Forum (as defined below) or other communication mechanism; and</li>\r\n<li>When you answer an assessment or update a Nutricia App or the website with information relevant to your pregnancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> When you create an Account we will collect certain information that may include information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, email address and phone number (&ldquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;PII&rdquo;). We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your gender, age, date of birth, zip code, baby&rsquo;s due date or baby&rsquo;s birthday. &nbsp;(All of the above and User Content, collectively, &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Information Collected Using Cookies.</strong> We collect certain information through the use of &ldquo;cookies,&rdquo; which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you&rsquo;ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don&rsquo;t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Information Related to Use of the Services.</strong> Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as &ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;), including both Account and non-account holders (&ldquo;Users&rdquo;). Log Data may include information such as a User&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device ID, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, interactions between a Customer and Coaches, health history and habits, and Content that a User submits to the Services. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users&rsquo; needs and preferences. We may use a person&rsquo;s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Location Information.</strong> In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address or mobile GPS data into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social Networking Sites.</strong> You may also choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties including social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. You may (and may be required to) share information about or give us access to additional third-party websites or services.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Financial Transactions. &nbsp;</strong>When you purchase Nutricia products, we may collect other information such as credit card numbers and/or cell phone numbers, as well as other information about you necessary to ensure that the transaction is properly authorized, such as your address, zip code, and cv number (collectively, &ldquo;Payment Information&rdquo;). We also may retain such information (or our third party &ldquo;fulfillment house&rdquo;, such as PayPal, may retain such information) to facilitate future transactions. See &ldquo;Controlling Your Personal Information&rdquo; below if you would like us not to use that information to assist you in completing future transactions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>User Content.</strong> &nbsp;In addition to information about yourself, it may be possible for you to submit other content (\"Content\"), such as photos and other media, each of which you present through technology available through the Services. It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional information, and whether you would like to make it available to others. However, Nutricia has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your Content (or the public if you make any information available to the public) use that material, or to whom they may forward it.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we may use information that you include in emails to us to assist us in providing the Service, and we may publish that information on an anonymous basis. In addition, the text of any posting on any one of the forums, bulletin boards, or other similar publically accessible systems offered by Nutricia becomes the property of Nutricia, and may be republished by Nutricia in its sole discretion.</p>\r\n<h2>What Personally Identifiable Information Do We Share?</h2>\r\n<p>Personal Information about our Users is an integral part of our business.

Further, if a comment you make on the discussion board or in the chat room contains Personal Information, we cannot control how the Personal Information will be used or disclosed by the other users of the discussion board or chat room. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, in any comment and/or message, and to be careful about the people to whom you send such comments and/or messages. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS DISCLOSED BY YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF BY YOUR SYSTEM ON DISCUSSION BOARDS, IN CHAT ROOMS OR OTHERWISE THROUGH THE SITES.</p>\r\n<p>Messaging Services: We may provide functionality to permit you to send messages, including instant messages, to other users through the websites.

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS DISCLOSED BY YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF BY YOUR SYSTEM IN SUCH MESSAGES.</p>\r\n<p>User Profiles: We may provide functionality to permit you to create a user profile page in which you may provide User Content. &nbsp;User Content may be displayed to other users (including members of your group(s), who may be from the same deployment or otherwise affiliated) to facilitate user interaction within the Sites. Email addresses are used to add new User Content to user profiles and to communicate through User Content. Users&rsquo; email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by us, except when the user is &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email address in their User Profile. Please note that any Personal Information you make available, including User Content, on or through your profile page may be available for other users, the Company, administration, moderators, and other staff. &nbsp;Additionally, other users may be able to post comments and view posted comments on your profile page.</p>\r\n<p>Communication in Response to User Content: As part of the Sites and Services, you will receive from us email and other communication relating to your User Content. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Content, we may send you email and other communication that we determine, in our sole discretion, as related to your User Content.</p>\r\n<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: In order to provide you with the optimal user experience, we anticipate that we may become affiliated, and work closely with a variety of third-party businesses. In certain situations, these businesses may sell products or services to you through the Sites. In other situations, we may provide services, or sell products, jointly with affiliated businesses. You should be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transactions, and throughout the course of the transactions, we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</p>\r\n<p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products and/or services to you.

Please note that you may receive additional offers as we process your request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information, including Personal Information about customers, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if the Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that the Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. By continuing to use our Sites and Services, you acknowledge that if we sell or transfer our business (e.g., through an acquisition) or an asset (e.g., our website) to another company, we will share your Personal Information with such company and will require such company to use and protect your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n<p>Protection of the Company and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our users, or others.
