Introduction
============

Django Basic CMS enable you to create and administrate hierarchical pages in a simple and powerful way.

Django Basic CMS is based around a placeholders concept. A placeholder is special template tag that
you use in your page templates. Every time you add a placeholder in your template  a field
dynamically appears in the page admin.

The project code repository is found at this address: http://github.com/YD-Technology/django-basic-cms

How to contribute
==================

I recommend to `create a clone on github  <http://github.com/YD-Technology/django-basic-cms>`_ and
make your modifications in your branch. There is a things that is nice to do:

  * Follow the pep08, and the 79 characters rules.
  * Add new features in the `doc/changelog.rst` file.
  * Document how the user might use a new feature.
  * It's better if a new feature is not activated by default but with a new setting.
  * Be careful of performance regresssion.
  * Write tests so the test coverage stay over 90%.
  * Every new CMS setting should start with PAGE_<something>
  * Every new template_tag should start with pages_<something>

Test it
-------

To test this CMS checkout the code with git::

    $ git clone git://github.com/YD-Technology/django-basic-cms.git django-basic-cms

Install the dependencies::

    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ wget -c http://github.com/YD-Technology/django-basic-cms/raw/master/requirements/external_apps.txt
    $ sudo pip install -r external_apps.txt

And then, run the development server::


    $ cd example/
    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py build_static
    $Â python manage.py manage.py runserver


YD-Technology CMS try to keep the code base stable. The test coverage is higher
than 80% and we try to keep it this way. To run the test suite::

    python setup.py test

.. note::

    If you are not admin you have to create the appropriate permissions to modify pages.
    After that you will be able to create pages.

Handling images and files
---------------------------

YD-Technology include a image placeholder for basic needs. For a more advanced
files browser you could use django-filebrowser:

  * http://code.google.com/p/django-filebrowser/

Once the application installed try to register the `FileBrowseInput` widget to make it
available to your placeholders.

Translations
------------

This application is available in English, German, French, Spanish, Danish, Russian and Hebrew.
